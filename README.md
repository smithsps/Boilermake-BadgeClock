=====================

Badge Clocks!

Simple 12 hour clocks utilizing the 16 LED display.
Uses a simple terminal read from serial for the inital sync.

#### Future Plans

- Fix the flaw of not have a hard clock, without this the clock will eventually fall out of sync.  
    To counter this we can have another badge to be connected to a computer and act as a time server, or the possiblity of having the computer to use another radio interface to act as an timeserver.
- General cleanup and make nice of code :)
